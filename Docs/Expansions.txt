Expansion Pack 1: The "Council of AIs" (Multi-Agent System)

Instead of one single model making decisions, you build a distributed system of specialized "Agents" that must debate each other before a trade is approved. This is very popular in 2024/2025 research (often called "Mixture of Experts").

    The Analyst Agent (LLM): Scrapes news and Twitter. It doesn't look at charts; it only reads text. It outputs a sentiment score (0-100).

    The Chartist Agent (Transformer/Chronos): Looks only at price action and technicals. It is blind to the news.

    The On-Chain Agent (Web3): Watches the blockchain directly (see Expansion Pack 3). It flags if "Whales" are moving money to exchanges (usually a sell signal).

    The Supreme Court (Meta-Model): A simple logistic regression model that takes the inputs from the three agents above. If the Analyst says "Buy," but the On-Chain Agent says "Whale Dump Imminent," the Court rules HOLD.

Expansion Pack 2: Upgrade Your Brain (Foundation Models)

LSTMs (from your original list) are solid but slightly dated (2018 era). The "cool" new tech in Time Series forecasting involves Foundation Models—basically "LLMs for Numbers."

    Chronos (by Amazon): It treats time-series data like language tokens. It’s pre-trained on billions of data points. You can fine-tune it on your specific crypto pair.

    Time-GPT (by Nixtla): Another generative pre-trained transformer specifically for time series.

    Why it's cool: These models can often perform "Zero-Shot" forecasting—predicting the future of a coin they have never seen before, just based on its recent pattern.

Expansion Pack 3: The "Eye of Sauron" (On-Chain Analysis)

Most bots only look at Centralized Exchange (CEX) data (Binance/Coinbase). But crypto actually happens on the blockchain. If you look at the chain, you see the future before it hits the exchange.

    Whale Watching: Use Web3.py to monitor the top 100 wallet addresses for the coin you are trading.

        Logic: If a wallet holding $10M of ETH suddenly moves it to a Binance Deposit Address, a dump is likely coming in ~10 minutes. Your bot can front-run the crash.

    Mempool Scanning: (Advanced) Watch the "pending" transactions in the blockchain mempool. This is how MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots work.

Expansion Pack 4: The "Pro" UI (TradingView Integration)

Since you are using Streamlit, don't settle for static matplotlib images.

    Library: streamlit-lightweight-charts (A wrapper for TradingView's library).

    Feature: This gives you a fully interactive financial chart inside Streamlit. You can zoom, pan, and draw lines.

    The Cool Part: Overlay your Bot's Brain on the chart. Plot a little "Robot Icon" exactly where your bot bought/sold, and color-code the background based on the bot's internal "Confidence Score" (e.g., Green background = Bot is 90% sure price will go up).
