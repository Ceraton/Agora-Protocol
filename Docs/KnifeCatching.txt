"Knife Catching" is the most dangerous but potentially profitable form of Mean Reversion. In engineering terms, you are betting on Elasticity: the assumption that if price stretches too far from its average (physics), it must snap back.

To implement this safely within your architecture, we treat it as a "Black Swan" Protocol. It requires its own dedicated Agent and a specific execution logic that differs from standard trading.

Here is the blueprint for the "Newton Agent" (Action = Reaction).
1. The Strategy Logic (The Physics of a Crash)

A falling knife isn't just "price went down." It is defined by Standard Deviations (σ).

    Normal Trade: Price is 1$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ from the Mean (Bollinger Bands).

    Knife Catch: Price is 4$\sigma$ or 5$\sigma$ away. It is a statistical anomaly.

The Entry Triggers:

    Velocity: Price drops > 3% in 5 minutes.

    Extension: Price is > 5% below the 200 EMA.

    Exhaustion: RSI (Relative Strength Index) < 15 (Standard is 30).

    Climax: Volume spike > 5x the 20-minute average (Panic Selling).

2. The Agent: NewtonAgent

This agent remains Silent (Returns Vote.HOLD) 99% of the time. It only wakes up during crashes.

3. Execution: The "Limit Ladder" (Game Dev Style)

You never market buy a falling knife. You set a trap. Instead of one order, the Execution Engine fires a Ladder of limit orders deeper into the crash.

The Ladder Logic:

    Rung 1: Buy 20% size @ Current Price - 1%.

    Rung 2: Buy 30% size @ Current Price - 2%.

    Rung 3: Buy 50% size @ Current Price - 4%.

Why? If it keeps crashing, you get a better average price. If it bounces instantly, you at least caught some of it.
4. Aristotelian Guardrails (The Safety)

Your Aristotle Validator must be updated. Normally, Aristotle hates high risk. But for Knife Catching, we appeal to the Virtue of Courage—but tempered by Temperance (Size).

Rule Update:

    If Strategy == "Knife Catch":

        Max Position Size: Reduced to 0.5% of Portfolio (Standard is 2%).

        Take Profit: Immediate. Sell at 1.5% profit. Do not hold for a home run.

        Time Limit: If profit is not hit in 15 minutes, SELL at market. (A knife that stops falling but doesn't bounce is a "Dead Knife"—very dangerous).

5. Streamlit Visualization (The "Impact Zone")

In your Dashboard, add a visual for "Distance from Mean."

Summary of Implementation

    Strategy: Add NewtonAgent to your Council. It usually sleeps.

    Execution: Modify order_executor.py to support submit_ladder_order() (batching 3 limit orders).

    Risk: Update AristotleValidator to allow high-risk trades only if size is < 0.5%.

    Exit: Implement a "Time-Based Stop" (e.g., close_position_after_seconds(900)).

This allows you to catch knives with "Math" rather than "Gut," keeping your complex engineering approach intact.
